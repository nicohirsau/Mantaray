# OpenGL Wrapper

This library is supposed to become a lightweight OpenGL wrapper.

To build this library, make sure to have the GNU compiler collection and `make` installed.

There are 4 commands to choose from:  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`make` -> Builds the release and debug build of the library.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`make release`-> Builds the release build of the library.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`make debug`-> Builds the debug build of the library.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`make clean`-> Deletes the built libraries.  

An example of the library being used can be found under `examples/snake`.
To build it make sure to have built the release build of Mantaray first.
Then go to the `examples/snake` folder and call `make run` to build and execute the example.

## It is currently under heavy development and not yet suited for the public use
